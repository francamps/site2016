Personalization in music, ecommerce and other experiences online was relatively straightforward and very easy to understand by the user.</p>\n<p>However, education was a whole other matter. First, because the depth and ambition of the type of personalization Knewton was providing goes beyond that kind of experiences by a huge margin. And secondly, the audience for our communications were stakeholders from organizations and institutions that were not only used to functioning in a very classic way but were also not necessarily tech-savy. And these were the people that needed to trust our platform to help their educational products serve students better.</p>\n<p>Shortly after joining, we explored different ways in which we could visually tell the story of a set of students going through educational material in completely personalized way, while showing scale.</p>\n<p>After pulling the students history from our databases and repackaging with python, we used a graph visualizer to generate a visual display of the graph of our course according to certain aspects we wanted to display.</p>\n<p>Normalizing student times to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Here we can see topics organized by color, difficulty (top to bottom, less to more difficult), and around 500 students jumping from a subset of concepts to another according to their specific characteristics. The visualization was built in processing.</p>\n<p>A visualization showing the complexity of a self-paced adaptive course with &gt;500 students, at Arizona State University.
