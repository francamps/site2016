The data in the conversation is then handled to produce several metrics and visualizations that inform the user on the patterns of her individual conversations with other people.</p>\n<p>In order to assure complete privacy and not having to deal with potential data breaches, all of the parsing, modeling, data handling and visualization logic happens in the frontend. User data is never sent to the server or stored anywhere but the userâ€™s laptop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/content/work/whatsappinside00.png\" alt=\"Whatsapp\">\n<img src=\"/assets/content/work/whatsappinside01.png\" alt=\"Whatsapp\">\n<img src=\"/assets/content/work/whatsappinside02.png\" alt=\"Whatsapp\">\n<img src=\"/assets/content/work/whatsappinside03.png\" alt=\"Whatsapp\"></p>\n"}
