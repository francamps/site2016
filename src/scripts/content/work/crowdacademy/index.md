A proof of concept for a set of tools for founder and project starters on crowdfunding platforms.

CrowdAcademy is a toolbox for the optimization and planning of crowdfunding campaigns, especifically tailored for [Goteo's platform](http://www.goteo.org "Goteo's platform") needs.

With the increase of interest in the platform and the number of projects presented, we wanted to increase the capacity of Goteo to ingest and publish projects while keeping the standard for preivous planning very high. Additionally, we wanted to offer complete information to starters about the state of their projects so that they understand the realistic success probabilities and respond accordingly.

The goal, on the one hand, was to optimize and streamline the process of assessment and readiness of campaigns, by providing tools to self-assess, standardize variables to evaluate and improve tools already in use by jury at Goteo to work with projects starters in the period before the campaign.

On the other hand, we'd like to progressively incorporate data that has been collected in the platform over time in order to provide reliable information to future project founders and provide statistical support to their decision-making processes.
