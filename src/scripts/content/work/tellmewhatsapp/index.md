On summer 2016 I launched [Tell Me Whatsapp Inside](http://www.tellmewhatsappinside.com), an analytics dashboard to explore your own personal Whatsapp conversations and gain insight into your communication patterns.

The dashboard parses the \*.txt file that can be obtained through the official Whatsapp app for each conversation. The data in the conversation is then handled to produce several metrics and visualizations that inform the user on the patterns of her individual conversations with other people.

In order to assure complete privacy and not having to deal with potential data breaches, all of the parsing, modeling, data handling and visualization logic happens in the frontend. User data is never sent to the server or stored anywhere but the user's laptop.
