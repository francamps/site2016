12 months of crowdfunding, for Goteo. An analysis and visualization of the first 12 months of activity of Goteo, a crowdfunding site for social projects, based in Spain (Processing and Geopy). The project output was an online interactive report of those first 12 months plus a video visualization of the contributions and reach of each project presented, getting a sense of scale that grows in intensity as projects with more impact get on the platform.

You can see a live version of the report [here](http://www.franc.ly/Goteo/index_en.html).
