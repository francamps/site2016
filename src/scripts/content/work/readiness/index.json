Personalization in music, ecommerce and other experiences online was relatively straightforward and very easy to understand by the user. However, to understand the idea in the context of an educational experience was a whole other matter.</p>\n<p>There a few reasons for this. First, the depth and ambition of the type of personalization Knewton was providing attempts to go beyond those other kind of experiences. Secondly, the audience for our communications were stakeholders from organizations and institutions that were not only used to functioning in a very classical way but were also not necessarily tech-savy. And these were the people that needed to trust our platform to help their educational products serve students better.</p>\n<p>Shortly after joining, we explored different ways in which we could visually tell the story of a set of students going through educational material in a completely personalized way, while showing scale. The experience of personalization at scale could only be understood when seen in action.</p>\n<p>After pulling the students history from our databases, we used a graph visualizer to generate a visual display of the graph of our course according weighing in certain properties of the graph and the relationship between the different concepts involved, represented as nodes.</p>\n<p>Here we can see topics organized by color, difficulty (top to bottom, less to more difficult), and around 500 students jumping from a subset of concepts to another according to their specific characteristics. The visualization was built in Processing, and still used at the moment to help communicate the idea of personalization of student experience at scale.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 500px; margin: 0 auto\"><iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/41239373\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n"}
