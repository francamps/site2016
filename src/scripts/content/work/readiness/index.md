When I joined Knewton in early 2012, we found that we were consistently challenged by the difficulty of explaining what the Knewton platform did. Personalization in music, ecommerce and other experiences online was relatively straightforward and very easy to understand by the user.

However, education was a whole other matter. First, because the depth and ambition of the type of personalization Knewton was providing goes beyond that kind of experiences by a huge margin. And secondly, the audience for our communications were stakeholders from organizations and institutions that were not only used to functioning in a very classic way but were also not necessarily tech-savy. And these were the people that needed to trust our platform to help their educational products serve students better.

Shortly after joining, we explored different ways in which we could visually tell the story of a set of students going through educational material in completely personalized way, while showing scale.

After pulling the students history from our databases and repackaging with python, we used a graph visualizer to generate a visual display of the graph of our course according to certain aspects we wanted to display.

Normalizing student times to accomplish.

Here we can see topics organized by color, difficulty (top to bottom, less to more difficult), and around 500 students jumping from a subset of concepts to another according to their specific characteristics. The visualization was built in processing.
