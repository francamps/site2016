In the same line as other projects, _Whatsapp sculptures_ explores the traces we leave when we live online and reimagines how we visualize and think of them

As a person who spends large amounts of time online and keeps relationships of friendship, family and partnership in different cities and countries around the world, my use of Whatsapp and other messaging apps is frequent. In some cases, these conversations are more real and present the real-life time spent together. I tried to imagine what it would look like to explore those conversations, and whether they would reveal personal aspects about the way I lead my life with people.

This is a part of a series of explorations.

A partner relationship that ended up in a painful breakup. Some of the arguing happened via messaging (hence the big spikes at the end). After a long cautionary time of no contact, some friendly communication was reestablished.
