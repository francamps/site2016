_Unsend_ is an exploration in the traces we leave as we live some of our relationships online, our thoughts and the way some features of our personalities, insecurities and every rich angle of it translates into our experience online.

As I was getting ready to leave some of my life experiences in NY behind, I realized I had never emptied my _Drafts_ folder on Gmail. I have used email extensively in the past, as notetaker, as a way to keep in touch with friends and family, as a personal journal. It has been my notebook, always open.

The _Drafts_ folder on Gmail, which stores every email you start writing and do not end up sending. Coincidentally, I started using my Gmail in the spring of 2009, around the time I was preparing to move to New York, so in a way, that folder has been an account of all the things I never said, the jobs and PhDs I never applied to, the girls I never asked out in my 6 years in New York.

So I made a book out of it. I made a book with all the emails that Gmail saved for me. Emails that I was too scared to send, emails that I forgot I started writing, emails that I thought I was going to finish later. Emails that are empty, and show just a fleeing thought that I wanted to share with somebody. Emails that are long and go around in circles trying to understand failed relationships. Emails that are banal and funny, emails that are heavy and serious.

Now that it seems that email is on its way out from its central role in our electronic communications, being replaced by a landscape of messaging apps and walled gardens, I thought this could be a good way of paying tribute to a romantic idea of email.
