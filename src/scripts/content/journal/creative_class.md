I am very cautious with the current use of the idea of the "creative class" by the establishment. I find it sometimes loaded with social engineering perversion, used as a substitute for true artistic experimentation and political involvement.

Creatives are artists that have made themselves digestible by "innovative" companies, therefore ditching anything coming with the spirit that is political or socially rebellious, and is one of the big factors that catalyzes gentrification.

Cities and real estate development agencies use "creative class" because it sounds better than "white young college-educated people willing to work for little money under the promise of artistic fulfillment". They (we) are indeed white, culturally upper-middle class in a precarious financial situation, which is a different manifestation of a class of the ones traditionally thought of, but one class division after all that comes with a very specific set of demons.

If anything, and I talk about NY which is the only thing I know, nightlife is becoming less transgressive and less dangerous to the establishment, and neighborhoods and venues are every day more heavily race and class-divided.

(Full disclosure: I work for the marketing team of a tech company in Manhattan.).
